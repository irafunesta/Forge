GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE EXCEPTION

Version 3, 19 November 2007

Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
Preamble

Exception Intent

We want specified commercial and/or closed source ("CCS") applications to be able to use specified AGPL-licensed libraries
(the "covered software") despite the fact that not all CSS licenses are compatible with version 3 or later of the GNU Affero 
General Public License (the "AGPL"). This exception mostly covers game developers and game tool/ engine creators or similar
to be able to publish their work without the need to fully publish their source code to the customers and so ensure that those 
studios can continue making the beautiful games we all like.

0. Definitions

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program, covered by version 3 or any later
version of the GNU Affero General Public License (collectively, "AGPL"), or a work based on such work and licensed under 
the AGPL.

"Software" means either a compiled Program or compiled Library in binary form, distributed by Schroedinger Entertainment or a work 
based on such software.

1. Legal Terms and Conditions

As a special exception to the terms and conditions of the AGPL:

You have permission to copy, modify, propagate, and distribute a work that is formed entirely from the covered work and one or more 
work licensed under the terms and conditions of the AGPL or a work derivative of such a combination, even if such copying, 
modification, propagation, or distribution would otherwise violate the terms of the AGPL. You 
must comply with the AGPL in all respects for all of the covered work used to form the Software.

You may include this AGPL Exception and its grant of permissions when you distribute covered work under the
terms and conditions of the AGPL or Software covered by this license exception. Inclusion of this notice with such a distribution
constitutes a grant of such permission. If you do not wish to grant these permissions, remove this exception from your distribution.
